## some errors

### `Error while assigning the sketch template.`

I was getting this in 3.4 while attempting to start a new sketch.  
Turns out, my last active sketch was in `JavaScript mode`.  
Once I opened a sketch in `Java mode` **AND** switched to Java Mode, I was able to start a new sketch without this error.  

[Here is some source code](https://www.javatips.net/api/processing-master/app/src/processing/app/Mode.java) that spits out the error; I don't know the age of the example; would be interesting to dig around a bit more.


## Running from VS Code

<https://github.com/TobiahZ/processing-vscode>

1. Get the path to Processing:
  1. Open `Applications` (or folder where Processing is found)
  1. Open `terminal` app (I use `iTerm2`)
  1. Drag `Processing` from the finder window into terminal
  1. the path should appear
  1. -- OR --
  1. `sudo find / -name Processing3_4.app` (or whatever the exact name is)
1. Add Processing path to `PATH`
1. ... and then some more steps, that I didn't complete, as I did the below, instead.

-- OR --

1. Open Processing, and click the Tools -> Install "processing-java" menu item.
  1. This makes it available to the shell (presumably via `PATH` ????)
1. Install the [processing-vscode](https://github.com/TobiahZ/processing-vscode) extension
1. Open your sketch folder
1. run `Processing: Create Task File`
  1. `Cmd-P` + `>` + `Create Task File`
1. Run project: `Cmd-Shift P`
